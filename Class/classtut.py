# Example for creating class and object
# All classes have a function called __init__(),
# which is always executed when the class is being initiated
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)


# The __str__()
# function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
# If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1)


# Objects can also contain methods.
# Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.
# Let us create a method in the Person class:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()


# The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class,
# and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.
# It does not have to be named self

class Person:
  def __init__(mysillyobject, name, age):
    mysillyobject.name = name
    mysillyobject.age = age

  def myfunc(abc):
    print("Hello my name is " + abc.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)
p1.myfunc()


# You can modify properties on objects like this

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def myfunc(self):
    print("Hello my name is " + self.name)

p1 = Person("John", 36)

p1.age = 40

print(p1.age)
